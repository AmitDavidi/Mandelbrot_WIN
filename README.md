# Mandlebrot_WIN
Mandelbrot explorer for windows _ Linux available too
Hello, this program calculates the mandlebrot set up to double precision. you zoom in and out with your mouse - left click and right click.
this program requires alot of calculation, thus part of the program is used with C this is why the dll which is in the folder - myf.dll is required in order to run the program.
enjoy.
